The gene that I focused on was XM_037677944.1. 
ATAC-Seq peaks represents open chromatic regions with regulatory elemeents and RNA-Seq peaks signifies amount of RNA transcripts that shows expression level. 
Near the beginning of the gene, there are no ATAC-seq peaks but high RNA-seq peaks. It means that this region is highly expressed. 
One thing I was confused is why there was no ATAC-seq peaks. 
Maybe theregulatory region of this gene is in different location and promotes expression of this gene from further away.
However, the peak height of the larval stage is bigger than the diapause stage which means it is more highly expressed in larval stage.
